## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Public Release

This is the first public release of AgentUX, a comprehensive framework for building interfaces that work for both humans and AI agents. The framework addresses a critical gap: approximately 80% of AI agents use simple HTTP requests without JavaScript execution, making client-side rendered applications completely invisible to them.

**Key Highlights:**
- Complete framework specification based on peer-reviewed research
- Practical validation tools ready for immediate use
- Implementation examples for popular frameworks
- Comprehensive documentation for developers and researchers

**What's Working:**
- All validation tools are functional
- Documentation is comprehensive and reviewed
- Examples demonstrate both passing and failing scenarios
- Framework maturity model provides clear adoption path

**Known Limitations:**
- NPM packages not yet published (coming soon)
- CI/CD workflows need real-world testing
- Limited framework integrations (more coming)
- Performance testing needed at scale

**Next Steps:**
- Publish tools to npm registry
- Expand framework examples (Svelte, Angular, etc.)
- Build community case studies
- Develop browser extensions and IDE plugins
- Create video tutorials and workshops

**For Contributors:**
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get involved. We're especially interested in:
- Real-world case studies and implementations
- Framework-specific plugins and integrations
- Performance benchmarking data
- Accessibility audits and improvements
