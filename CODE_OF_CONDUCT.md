# BiModal Design Community Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The BiModal Design project is dedicated to building interfaces that work for both
humans and AI agents. We are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful, and
collaborative community where everyone can contribute to advancing agent-human
interface design regardless of experience level, background, or identity.

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability,
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- **Constructive Collaboration**: Providing thoughtful feedback on designs,
  code, and documentation
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Helping others understand BiModal Design principles and
  implementation techniques

  newcomers feel welcome
- **Respect for Diverse Perspectives**: Acknowledging that different approaches
  to UX problems can be valid

  considered inappropriate in a professional setting

  activities
- **Spam or Self-Promotion**: Excessive promotion of unrelated projects or
  commercial products

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests
- Documentation and example code
- Community forums and discussions
- Social media interactions related to BiModal Design
- Events, conferences, and meetups (virtual or in-person)
- Private communications when they relate to community activities

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing
the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: conduct@agentux.design  
**GitHub**: Create a private issue or contact maintainers directly

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community
leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any
incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## BiModal Design-Specific Guidelines

### Technical Discussions

  implementers
- **Accessibility Mindset**: Consider both human accessibility and agent
  compatibility in all proposals
- **Performance Awareness**: Discuss the performance implications of suggested
  approaches

### Design Critique

- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide specific, actionable suggestions for
  improvement
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Consider how proposed solutions affect different
  types of users and agents
- **Standards Alignment**: Reference relevant accessibility standards and best
  practices
- **Real-World Context**: Consider practical implementation constraints and
  business requirements

### Documentation Contributions

- **Clarity First**: Write for both beginners and experienced developers
- **Complete Examples**: Provide working code examples that can be tested
- **Accurate Information**: Verify that examples and claims are correct before
  submitting
- **Inclusive Language**: Use terminology that is accessible to global
  contributors

## Community Recognition

We recognize valuable community contributions including:

- **High-Quality Bug Reports**: Detailed reports that help improve the framework
