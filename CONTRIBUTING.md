## Development Workflow

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplication
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes
3. **Get feedback** before spending significant time

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our guidelines:
   - Write clear, self-documenting code
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   # Run validation tool tests
   cd tools/validators
   npm test

   # Test on real websites
   node fr1-checker.js https://example.com --verbose
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: New validation check for ARIA landmarks

   - Implement comprehensive ARIA landmark detection
   - Add scoring based on semantic completeness
   - Include detailed error messages for missing landmarks
   - Update tests to cover edge cases

   Fixes #123"
   ```

## Pull Request Process

2. **Maintainer review** for code quality and alignment
3. **Community feedback** for significant changes
4. **Documentation review** for accuracy and clarity
5. **Final approval** and merge by maintainers

## Documentation Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise** - Avoid unnecessary jargon

### Documentation Structure

- **Purpose** - What problem does this solve?
- **Audience** - Who is this for?
- **Prerequisites** - What do they need to know first?
- **Step-by-step** - Clear, numbered instructions
- **Examples** - Working code samples
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

### Code Examples

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear, commented, complete example
// Detect if visitor is an AI agent
function detectAgent() {
  const userAgent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
  const agentPatterns = /bot|crawler|spider|agent/;
  return agentPatterns.test(userAgent);
}

// Apply agent-specific optimizations
if (detectAgent()) {
  document.body.setAttribute('data-agent-visitor', 'true');
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Validation Tools

All changes to validation tools must include tests:

```bash
# Run existing tests
npm test

# Add new tests in test/ directory
# Follow existing patterns for consistency
```

### Documentation Testing

- **Link checking** - Ensure all links work
- **Code examples** - Verify all examples are functional
- **Cross-platform** - Test on different operating systems
- **Accessibility** - Ensure documentation itself is accessible

### Real-world Testing

For significant changes, test on real websites:

- Choose diverse site architectures (SSR, SSG, CSR)
- Document results and any edge cases found
- Include testing methodology in PR description
